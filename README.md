# Forest_Runner_Platformer

Forest Runner is a 2D platformer game made entirely in python.
<br>The game was made mostly using the pygame library, which is integrated into the programming language itself, as well as other libraries for integrating the background music and graphics of the game itself.
<br>During the development of the game, numerical methods were implemented for:

* Linear, rotational movement - RK4 (fourth-order Runge-Kutta) method with the law of conservation of momentum.
* Collision detection - SAT (Separating Axis Theorem) method
* Projectile movement - RK4 method for circular objects

In addition to numerical methods, certain algorithms for player animation, map scrolling, level loading, map loading, etc. have also been implemented.
<br>You can see more details about everything that was done in the game on the powerpoint presentation.
<br>Graphics and sounds are downloaded from the Internet from many different websites.
