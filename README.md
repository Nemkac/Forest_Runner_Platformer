# Forest_Runner_Platformer

Forest Runner is a platformer game made for the needs of a college project.
<br>The game was created in the python programming language using the pygame library. 
<br>During the development of the game, numerical methods were implemented for:

* Linear, rotational movement - RK4 (fourth-order Runge-Kutta) method with the law of conservation of momentum.
* Collision detection - SAT (Separating Axis Theorem) method
* Projectile movement - RK4 method for circular objects

In addition to numerical methods, certain algorithms for player animation, map scrolling, level loading, map loading, etc. have also been implemented.
<br>You can see more details about everything that was done in the game on the powerpoint presentation.
<br>Graphics and sounds are downloaded from the Internet from many different websites.
